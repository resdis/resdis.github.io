Disaggregation is an emerging compute paradigm that splits existing monolithic
servers into a number of consolidated single-resource pools that communicate
over a fast interconnect. This model decouples individual hardware resources,
including tightly coupled ones such as processors and memory, and enables the
composition of logical compute platforms with flexible and dynamic hardware
configurations.

The concept of disaggregation is driven by various recent trends in
computation. From an application perspective, the increasing importance of data
analytics and machine learning workloads in HPC centers brings unprecedented
need for memory capacity, which is in stark contrast with the growing imbalance
in the peak compute-to-memory capacity ratio of traditional system board based
server platforms where memory modules are co-located with processors. At the
hardware front, the proliferation of heterogeneous, special purpose computing
elements promotes the need for configurable compute platforms, while at the
same time, the increasing maturity of optical interconnects elevates the
prospects of better distance independence in networking infrastructure.

The workshop intends to explore various aspects of resource disgregation,
composability and their implications for high performance computing, both in
dedicated HPC centers as well as in cloud environments.
