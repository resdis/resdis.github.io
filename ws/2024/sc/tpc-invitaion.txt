Dear [their first name],

We would like to invite you to serve on the program committee of the 4th
International Workshop on RESource DISaggregation in High-Performance
Computing (RESDIS 2024) to be held in conjunction with the 2024 International
Conference for High Performance Computing, Networking, Storage and Analysis
(SC 2024).

The website of the previous edition of the workshop is as follows:

https://resdis.github.io/ws/2023/sc/

The workshop focuses on resource disaggregation and composable systems in
high-performance computing. Your most important responsibility as a program
committee member would be to review paper submissions.  We expect no more than
two paper reviews per PC member.  We are using the Linklings conference
management system.  There will be no physical program committee meeting
(workshop chairs will make acceptance decisions based on the reviews and any
follow-up discussions between reviewers in Linklings).

Tentative timeline:

August 2nd (Fri):      Submission deadline
August 23rd (Fri):     Reviews due
August 30th (Fri):     Acceptance notification
September 27th (Fri):  Final paper deadline
November 22nd (Fri):   Workshop date

We are strongly encouraging PC submissions and there is no limit on the
number of such submissions.  Once the Call for Papers is out, we will also
ask you to help solicit submissions from your collaborators and colleagues.

The workshop has not been publicly announced yet and the website for 2024 is
under construction.

Please respond to this invitation at your earliest convenience, but not later
than Saturday, May 4th.

We look forward to hearing from you and hope that you will accept this
invitation.

Best regards,

Balazs Gerofi <balazs.gerofi@intel.com>
